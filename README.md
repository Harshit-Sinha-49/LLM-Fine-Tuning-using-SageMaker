# LLM Fine-Tuning using SageMaker

## Introduction
Amazon SageMaker is a comprehensive machine learning service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed to simplify the entire machine learning workflow from data preparation to model deployment. It provides a range of tools and functionalities to cater to users with varying levels of expertise.
One of its key features is data labeling and preparation, facilitating efficient annotation and cleaning of datasets, which is essential for training accurate models. For model training, SageMaker offers managed environments supporting popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet, with the ability to scale training jobs across distributed clusters for faster processing and reduced costs.

## LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolutionary advancement in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These models are characterized by their ability to understand, generate, and manipulate human language at an unprecedented scale and level of complexity. 
LLMs are typically built on architectures such as Transformers, which enable them to process vast amounts of text data and learn intricate patterns and structures of language through self-supervised learning techniques.
One of the defining features of LLMs is their pre-training on large corpora of text data, followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks or domains. During pre-training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence of text given the context provided by preceding words. This process allows the model to develop a deep understanding of language semantics, syntax, and context, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

## LLaMA2
Llama 2 is a family of LLMs like GPT-3 and PaLM 2. While there are some technical differences between it and other LLMs, you would really need to be deep into AI for them to mean much. 
All these LLMs were developed and work in essentially the exact same way; they all use the same transformer architecture and development ideas like pretraining and fine-tuning.
When you enter a text prompt or provide Llama 2 with text input in some other way, it attempts to predict the most plausible follow-on text using its neural networkâ€”a cascading algorithm with billions of variables (called "parameters") that's modeled after the human brain. By assigning different weights to all the different parameters, and throwing in a small bit of randomness, Llama 2 can generate incredibly human-like responses.

## Problem Statement
Fine-tuning open LLMs from Hugging face using Amazon SageMaker, involving the following four steps: 
1. Setup development environment
1. Create and prepare the dataset
1. Fine-tune LLM using trl on Amazon SageMaker
1. Deploy & Evaluate LLM on Amazon SageMaker

#### Requirement Specifications- 
- AWS Account (Having an IAM role with the required permissions for SageMaker)
- Hugging Face account (For huggingface-cli login)

## Fine-tuning a LLM
Fine-tuning LaMa2 involves adapting its pre-trained parameters to better suit a particular task or dataset. Here's a general outline of the fine-tuning process:
- **Task Definition:** Define the specific task or tasks you want LaMa2 to perform, such as text classification, language generation, or sentiment analysis.
- **Data Preparation:** Collect and preprocess a dataset relevant to the task at hand. Ensure the dataset is properly annotated or labeled for supervised tasks.
- **Model Initialization:** Initialize LaMa2 with its pre-trained weights, which have been learned from a large corpus of text data.
- **Fine-Tuning Process:** Fine-tune LaMa2 on the task-specific dataset using techniques like gradient descent and backpropagation. During fine-tuning, the model's parameters are adjusted to minimize a defined loss function.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques to optimize performance on the fine-tuning task.
- **Validation and Monitoring:** Monitor the model's performance on a validation dataset during fine-tuning to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization to unseen data.
